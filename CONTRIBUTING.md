-   Familiarize yourself with the [README](README.md) and package functionality
-   Check existing [issues](https://github.com/ritechoice23/laravel-saveable/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/ritechoice23/laravel-saveable/pulls) to avoid duplicates

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

-   PHP 8.2 or higher
-   Composer
-   Git

### Installation

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork** locally:

    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/laravel-saveable.git
    cd laravel-saveable
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

4. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    # or

    ```

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome many types of contributions:

-   **Bug fixes**: Fix issues reported in the issue tracker
-   **New features**: Add new functionality (please discuss in an issue first)
-   **Documentation**: Improve README, code comments, or create examples
-   **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage
-   **Code quality**: Refactoring, optimization, or style improvements

### Before You Start

For major changes:

1. **Open an issue** first to discuss what you would like to change
2. Wait for feedback from maintainers
3. Once approved, create your pull request

For minor changes (typos, small bugs, documentation):

-   Feel free to submit a PR directly

## Coding Standards

### PHP Standards

We follow Laravel and PSR-12 coding standards:

-   Use **4 spaces** for indentation (no tabs)
-   Follow **PSR-12** naming conventions
-   Use **type hints** for parameters and return types
-   Write **descriptive variable and method names**
-   Keep methods **focused and single-purpose**

### Code Style

This project uses **Laravel Pint** for automatic code formatting:

```bash
composer format
```

**Always run Pint before committing** to ensure consistent code style.

### PHPStan

We use PHPStan for static analysis to catch potential bugs:

```bash
composer analyse
```

Ensure your code passes PHPStan analysis before submitting a PR.

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

Run the full test suite:

```bash
composer test
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
composer test-coverage
```

Run specific test files:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/HasSavesTest.php
```

Run tests by filter:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --filter=collection
```

### Writing Tests

-   **All new features** must include tests
-   **Bug fixes** should include a test that fails before the fix
-   Use **descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested
-   Follow the existing test structure and conventions
-   Aim for **high test coverage** (we maintain comprehensive coverage)

### Test Structure

```php
it('describes what the test does in plain English', function () {
    // Arrange: Set up test data
    $user = User::create(['name' => 'John Doe', 'email' => 'john@example.com']);
    $post = Post::create(['title' => 'Test Post', 'content' => 'Content']);

    // Act: Perform the action being tested
    $user->saveItem($post);

    // Assert: Verify the expected outcome
    expect($user->hasSavedItem($post))->toBeTrue();
});
```

### Test Categories

Tests are organized into categories:

-   **HasSavesTest.php**: Testing HasSaves trait (saveItem, unsaveItem, hasSavedItem, collections, etc.)
-   **IsSaveableTest.php**: Testing IsSaveable trait (timesSaved, isSavedBy, savers, scopes)
-   **SaveModelTest.php**: Testing Save model (relationships, scopes, filtering)
-   **CollectionModelTest.php**: Testing Collection model (parent-child relationships, items)

Add your tests to the appropriate file or create a new category if needed.

## Pull Request Process

## Documentation

### Code Comments

     * @param  Model  $model  The model to save
     * @param  Collection|null  $collection  Optional collection to save to
     * @param  array  $metadata  Optional metadata (notes, priority, etc.)
     * @return bool
     */
    public function saveItem(Model $model, ?Collection $collection = null, array $metadata = []): bool
    {
        // Implementation
    }
    ```

### README Updates

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for clear and standardized commit messages:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**

-   `feat:` - A new feature
-   `fix:` - A bug fix
-   `docs:` - Documentation only changes
-   `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
-   `refactor:` - Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
-   `test:` - Adding or updating tests
-   `chore:` - Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, etc.

-   `ci:` - CI/CD changes

**Example:**

```text

**Guidelines:**

-   Keep the subject line under 72 characters
